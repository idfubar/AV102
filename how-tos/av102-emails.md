1. Go to MailChimp, login as AgileVentures

2. Click on campaigns in top nav to get previous campaigns:

3. check what week is visible to learners in the AV102 course:

I have to say that I've got these all kind of confused.  Right now I'm about to send out part 9 (which corresponds to week 1 of the 2nd MOOC - I really need to sort all these numbers out - but then not that many people even get to this point).

But anyway the idea is to get a link to the specific week that the TAs should be submitting the efforts to:

4. Clone the appropriate previous emailing

including updating the link to the relevant part of the AV102 course.

8. Then send it out - although usually we should send a test email first to check the links are working etc ...
