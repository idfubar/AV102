Assignment Instructions
-----------------------

Spend at least 1 hour in a remote pair programming session, programming on an open source project. Please see #pairing_notifications channel on Slack for information on upcoming sessions or join an AgileVentures scrum to hook up with a pair partner.

To facilitate pairing on an open source project, please create an account at AgileVentures and browse the available open source, non-profit projects. You are most welcome to propose new projects, but if you want to quickly jump in to pair on an existing project you'll find the most active projects are LocalSupport and MetPlus.

Please change driver/navigator roles at least three times, and ensure that you are clear what the high level feature you are working on is, and ensure that you work on acceptance tests, unit tests and follow the red green, refactor methodology. See http://agileventures.org/remote-pair-programming/pair-programming-protocols for diagrams of pairing protocols for switching driver/navigator while going red, green, refactor.

Please insert the YouTube URL (or other hosted video link) of the recording of the remote pair programming session you participated in.

We realize that this is potentially a very challenging assignment. Please do your best, and don't worry too much if it ends up not being possible to complete it this week.

Criterion
---------

1. Pairing - Did the pairing video include at least one other person besides the submitter of the video?  
   * No - There was no video, or it was not a video of working on code, or is was just a single person working by themselves  
   * Yes - There was at least one other person besides the submitter participating in the video  
   
2. Rotation - Did the participants rotate driver/navigator roles at least once every 15 minutes?   This means that every 15 minutes the person who is typing stops and allows their partner to type for the next 15 minutes, while switching to an advisory "navigator" role.  
    * No - There was no driver navigator rotation, or perhaps just a single rotation in the video  
    * Yes - There were clear driver navigator rotations at least every 15 minutes, i.e. 4 per hour  
    
3. Communication - Did the pair continue to communicate effectively through the pairing process?  Specifically, did the driver explain what they were doing as, or around, the process of them typing.  Did the navigator ask questions or make suggestions or look up relevant documentation to the task at hand?  
    * No - There was little or no communication between driver and navigator.  
    * Yes - There was regular communication between the driver and the navigator.  Although there might be occasional silences it is clear from the communication that driver and navigator are focused on solving the same task together
