Hello and welcome to week 0, here we are, this is "AV102 ESaaS: Managing Distributed

1
00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.479
Teams".

2
00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.230
We're run this course several times now so "welcome back" if you've joined us before

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.330
and "hello" if this is the first time.

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.049
So I've got access to the site here.

5
00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.250
I can see more than you'll be able to see in the first week at the moment.

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.660
I've got a special staff view that shows me everything that's coming up. You'll be able

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.050
to see just this introduction.

8
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.170
I've got here like a little curriculum overview in my notes that I'll just go through.

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.090
In week 1 we'll focus on understanding the TA's role and we'll talk about how the TA

10
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.400
thing fits into managing distributed teams.

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.329
We'll go on to distributed software development, version control, cloud deployment, chores;

12
00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.660
all these things, all this stuff that overlaps between being a TA for the 169 course; working

13
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.030
with industry software generally and also doing open source development.

14
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.950
Going into week 3, we'll cover soft skills, the team management, online scrums, meeting

15
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.770
preparation, these sorts of things, the communication technologies to use.

16
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.090
And then finally week 4 it's all about bugs and problems and how to handle the world when

17
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.999
things go wrong which is of course really what it's all about.

18
00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:15.060
So I've got some administrivia here to go through.

19
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.009
Our team is all now thoroughly addicted to Slack chat which you may have heard of.

20
00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.530
Slack has really surged in popularity over the last couple of years, outdistancing competitors

21
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.149
like HipChat, and I think a lot of that is down to their careful attention to user needs

22
00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.689
and focus on making the interface friendly and easy to use.

23
00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.789
In some ways this is just all an enterprise version of IRC, but the ease of use makes

24
00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.679
quite a big difference.

25
00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:39.779
Let's show you the interface

26
00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:46.139
Here's the Agile Ventures Slack chat; we've got a number of different channels ... when

27
00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:52.229
you join you'll be automatically added to a few channels.

28
00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.599
General for general announcements, random just for random chat and tech talk for any

29
00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:01.380
technical questions.

30
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.409
Then also we've got this ESaaS 169 MOOC channel, we've got an AV102 distributed team's channel

31
00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:10.670
which you'll want to join.

32
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.730
One of the really nice things about Slack is that you'll get little alerts like this

33
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.420
when you get mentioned in a channel.

34
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.439
So I hope you're going to enjoy using Slack with us.

35
00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:28.799
This course is a work in progress developed entirely by volunteers like you.

36
00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.370
I just want to apologise upfront for any problems you encounter with our course.

37
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.349
If you do find issues with the course do get involved and help us fix them.

38
00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.489
We can give you access to the materials and you can join all the other great volunteers

39
00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.480
who are all alumni of the 169 course.

40
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.909
Please do jump in and help us out and please bear with us as we try to work around the

41
00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.709
open source technology behind edX edge and the associated course management software

42
00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.010
etc.

43
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.379
Speaking of things not working: my flaws; I'm Sam Joseph and I have many flaws, one

44
00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.469
of them is that I just speak too fast.

45
00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.180
I'm working on trying to improve that.

46
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.030
If I'm going too fast one thing you can do is slow down the videos.

47
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.030
In case you hadn't seen it there is a youtube feature to adjust the playback speed.

48
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.739
For example here's a little video from me with me talking very fast as usual and if

49
00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.519
you find that I'm talking too fast then you can go and switch me down to .5 and listen

50
00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.900
to me much more slowly.

51
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.879
We are also working on transcripts for our videos to make it easier to follow what I'm

52
00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.510
saying, and again if you'd like to help us with those we'd be very grateful indeed.

53
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.260
YouTube and edX now have pretty good support for managing the transcripts, but there's

54
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.959
still quite a lot of work involved, so your support is very much appreciated.

55
00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:55.239
So other things that I need to mention.

56
00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.680
Next up there's going to be a video here with me talking more about what the course is about

57
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.290
then next week, we're going on to understanding the TAs role and we'll talk about who are

58
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.109
TA's and why do we need you for the 169 course.

59
00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:19.670
We've got little quizzes here based on those videos talking about the TA responsibilities.

60
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.640
Before then we've got a very simple "start-off" homework which is just to register for the

61
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.630
upcoming 169 course and connect on the Agile Ventures Slack chat and make sure that you've

62
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.670
said hello there and you are all connected up and then we'll be able to start chatting

63
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.000
with you in the AV102 distributed teams Slack chat ...

64
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.840
So the course is sort of initially rather TA focused however taking this course doesn't

65
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.140
mean that you have to be a TA.

66
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.940
Of course we'd love everyone to contribute by being TA's in the 169 course which starts

67
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.600
in about five weeks from now but we'd just as equally like you to derive great value

68
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.120
from the topics we're talking about in terms of managing distributed teams and then use

69
00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.970
that in your own work or help out in Agile Ventures rather than being a TA.

70
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.040
What is Agile Ventures I hear you ask?

71
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.370
It's a big project incubator that we have created; lots of more great work by 169 alumni

72
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.250
and we've got lots of active projects in there and people doing pair programming online together

73
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.610
and improving their coding and team skills.

74
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.000
We've got our big flagship project, here's the Harrow Community Network where we can

75
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.300
see a big list of all the contributors from around the world who've submitted code.

76
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:36.630
You can see a big lists of projects here; it's all about: "learn to code", "hang out

77
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.720
with cool people", and "save the world" by contributing to charity projects.

78
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.380
We've been having a lot of fun over the last several years doing Agile Ventures; anyway

79
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.910
more of that as we go into the course.

80
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.510
The course itself runs independently for four weeks and then runs in parallel with the both

81
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.740
parts of the 169 MOOC.

82
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.810
As we've done for the last few runs you can get certificates for completing the standalone

83
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.340
part of the course, and higher level certificates for supporting students as a TA in the MOOCs

84
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.130
and also for contributing to the open source charity projects within Agile Ventures.

85
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.240
The basic part of the course shouldn't be more than 3 or 4 hours a week.

86
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.410
Also there's Mentive who provide more comprehensive support to the MOOC students, and potentially

87
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.070
you can get paid as a Mentive Mentor, which is a great opportunity that I can supply more

88
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.270
information about if you are interested.

89
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.920
So I think there thats about it in terms of the summary; there are probably things I've

90
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.120
forgotten

91
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.370
but I'm sure I can pass those on to you before too long

92
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.380
anyhow if you want to know what this course is "really" all about then go ahead and watch

93
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.080
this next video from me,

94
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.430
all right, bye for now
