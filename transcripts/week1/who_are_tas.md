Hi so I want to talk about the teaching assistant or T.A. prerequisites, their role and the importance the TA's. 

So the pre-requisites are that you've recently completed the 169 courses on edx.org

It doesn't have to be that you've completed 169.2 in particular because in the first instance we'll run them in order again, but you do need to have completed 169.1 to be a TA for the 169.1 course.

And you need to have completed 169.2 to be a TA for the 169.2 course, so you could say here "recently completed and/or" but there we go.

So that's a critical thing, if you've never taken the Engineering Software as a Service course on edX before then you might be in a difficult position to be a TA.

Although I guess if you're a Rails ninja and you know everything there is to know about Rails and Agile development then get in touch and we can probably sort something out.

What we're also angling for is you to have to completed this ESaaS managing distributed teams course which is this course that you are taking now and that's available on edX edge, which is another edX course provider.

We're also looking for you to have a certain amount of time available to commit to working with students; preferably a few hours a week but you know as much or as little as you can as you can spare.

Really we'd love more but if you're only going to be available for less than, say, three minutes a week then you know we probably can't work together so easily.

So that's the key prerequisites for being a TA, but what about the role of the TA?

So the TA is the student's personal connection to the course.

The students have access to material, they have the videos, they have the autograders, they have the forums and so on but the TA is kind of the face of the course for the student. 

They're the person who might spend the most time actually giving direct human interaction  through the course so that's very important.

And the role of the TA, as well as being the personal connection, is to be the mentor to assist students with problems that they're having with the coursework, with comprehending some of the difficult concepts in the course and so on 

Another thing that's really valuable for TAs to do is report courseware issues 

We've had some great bug reporting from TA's that have allowed us to fix a lot of issues  with the course, and it's not just reporting, you could even get involved with helping fix things.

For example with the development of the courseware, and also for the autograders. 

There are big open source programming projects behind the auto graders that some TA's have  got really deeply involved in and that's all there if you're interested in it.

However these are the key roles of TA's in the first instance.

So why it was important we have TA's?

It's a big course with thousands of students who are all trying to master material which in turns can be difficult and challenging.

All the students are spread out over the world and are awake at different times of the global cycle and so we need a sizable number of TAs in all different timezones.

We really need to have TA's around the world who can respond to those students' needs. 

Ultimately there are some very advanced students who can maybe get through the course material without any interaction with other humans although I think that they're missing out on great aspects of the course if that's what they do.

Many students will need a guide, they will need guidance from mentors who understand the material and the TA's are critical in providing this sort of help.

So you might be asking what's the relation to distributed teams here?

The TA's themselves because there are hundreds of them are a distributed team who need to work together and support one another.

The students themselves are also then an even larger distributed group and they'll form small teams for pairing on assignments and also we're moving towards having projects in the 169 course with small groups of students collaborating and using the agile development methods.

We're particularly looking towards a day in the not too distant future when TA's will be project managing those sort of teams.

Thus we think it's very important for you as TAs to learn all about distributed teams and teamwork, to help with being part of the big distributed TA team and also in the future for working with teams of students.
