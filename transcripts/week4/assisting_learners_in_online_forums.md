So let's just talk about generally ...
I've gone on about - like - let's try and make sure all the discussion happens in the groups ...
let's try and moderate ... adjust
the length of our more posts to whether we're in IM or whether we are in
the Stack Exchange. A key ...
let's be civil and polite. I do my best I mean
I
.. if I'm ever not civil and polite you can like hold me back and say "Sam, look -
you said in this slide that we should be civil and polite." I think it's ...
I generally find this like ... often we all get frustrated and angry with
the technology doesn't do we want; people don't seem to be behaving in the way
we
want them to
... generally if we get angry and frustrated and we let that boil over
into how we interact with people
we tend to find that those people are going to be less helpful;
the people around us. If we're angry they're gonna be less helpful. I guess
there's a kinda ...
I mean this is maybe cultural there's maybe in some
situations where unless ... maybe in some cultures maybe unless you are being really
angry
you won't get a response? I think that's ...
yeah, maybe that's just the way it is and so maybe I have
to be accepting of
some people are going to be angry sometimes ...
and thats
culturally how they are? I guess I'm not a big fan of anger; I hate people
being angry at me; I don't want to be angry at people;
so I'm a big fan of the
"Be civil and polite" and I think often ...
I don't know I think the problem is when people start getting
angry it raises the temperature; it gets
difficult to think.
I think if we're all being civil and polite then
its easier for everybody to think and we can come to solutions more quickly?
Anyway so everybody ... we're all learners; whether this is a
distributed team
or a MOOC or what have you, we're all hear to
learn; we're all
trying to ... this is life right? Life is about learning we're trying to
become ... better understand
how to make the most effective use the resources around us;
so let's be patient with each other; we're all trying to
learn; we've all got something to offer
yes and if we can be patient and civil and polite
with each other we can discover what that is;
maybe ... so I mean I've already alluded to it;
distributed teams, this course, the world TA Course
AgileVentures
... span the globe; there are huge cultural differences, language barriers, all
sorts of
things.
Let's respect those and try ... I like to think about the human
race
... the entire universe ... we're one! We're one big team
although we may seem like we're going in different directions at different times, we're
one big
team
and I think that to the extent that we can honour and respect each other's
differences
and see past those to ... we're all trying to
achieve wealth and bounty for all I hope
then that's to all our benefit. So the key forum rules
really are
let's be patient, let's be respectful, let's be civil and polite so let's -
if people are ... if students for example in the
in the MOOC are not respecting
those rules - if members of your distributed team are
not respecting each other - then I think gently but firmly
you want to remind people & say: "Hey that you know could be
misinterpreted, let's be sensitive there." It's
difficult it's ... we sort of
say
also moderate as little as possible. I mean that's kinda of like a
judgement call;
in any situation with a team whether its centralized or distributed
or it's online. I mean there's a particular thing I think about online courses
online teams
where particularly text in emails
... someone is frustrated ... it can easily be taken out of
context. Things can get very heated
purely in email and we don't .. we try and avoid ...
actually for AgileVentures
and also the MOOC we try and avoid using email where possible ... but
similarly within
forums like StackExchange and so on, what you thought of as a joke can
turn out to be something very offensive for somebody else ... it's just ...
it's hard
and I think I have yet to work out a list
or a little metric or a rule of thumb
that will magically allow you to not offend everybody and so on
but so it's a kind of ... I think the key thing is to be going into every
situation
calmly and if you're
suggesting to someone that they might change their behavior for whatever
reason that you want to do that
in a way that tries to ... that starts off by
acknowledging their positive
contributions. You say:
"that's a fantastic response but I think that that joke you made at the end might
be taken out ...
might be offensive for some people and so on" and let's ...
the key thing really is keep talking ... if there's an issue let's -
let's keep talking about it and hopefully we
can resolve it ...
so yeah I think I've kind of ...
I've kind of run ahead there. I mean to the extent that we have
questions running in
ongoing discussions going in sort of threads like this then
you know if people are kinda like veering crazily off topic
like: "Oh yes I had this completely different issue that ... about something totally
unrelated
but let me ask" ... that is going to be difficult for other people to find, like the
title
of this
topic is not particularly relevant anymore so we might want to say: "Hey oh that's
a
very important question, can we move that over into a
different
sub topic and so on" ... this is one advice that comes down from edX
"End conversations that are no longer productive". I mean part of the
reason that I
am very keen on the chat environment and bringing that in
is I think sometimes it's good to just chat ... I mean you also need
to know
when to stop just chatting ... I guess if people ...
if people are just busy arguing about something and they're not listening to each
other and they're just being unpleasant
and that creates a negative vibe then you want to kind of
say: "Hey guys let's wrap this up or should we you know what should we do?
Let's work out a way to finish it up." Yeah so
you want to get everyone to be civil.
If there are people duplicating threads ... I mean they'll be
a situation
...
lots of people will be coming in who maybe haven't
used Stack Exchange before. They may
replicate additional questions in here
so you might say "Oh this is a duplicate of this question, let's move the
conversation over there!"
Perfectly reasonable thing to do ... and particularly point to people by
saying "Oh you know before you ask a question
do check using the search functionality to see if
someone's already asked it, if the answers already there and
do participate in the
existing topics rather than starting new threads".
So I mean that's kinda like more general I guess ...
station keeping ... when it comes to assisting learners and this might
be
another member of your distributed team who
is
... got stuck ... might be a
student that you're helping in a MOOC ... I mean
I guess for the ...
to the extent that it's a student who's really focusing their time on
on being a learner ... you kind of want to help them without revealing an answer;
offer scaffolding and allow the ... we've talked about education
scaffolding
before which is not revealing the answer and basically allowing students to solve their
own problem.
In a distributed team that might be different in
that you - if your goal is just ...
to get something done as quickly as possible,
you might ... with your distributed team you just want
to tell the person that this is
the solution
... I guess that's maybe the key difference between the
people who are coming and saying "Right, I really want to
learn here", although
that has a place as well in distributed teams in that ...
what you kind of want to do is not have a situation where
other team members are just dependent on you for answering questions all the time
... what you wanna do is try and help all of
your team members
build independence ... generally
one of the reasons that we're trying to train as many
TAs as possible is to provide timely answers in the forums ... if
you can
get in there and give an answer - fantastic! ... and that's
a general rule I think with a distributed team
as well, the quicker that you
can get feedback
the happier people generally are; although of course
we can't be perfect and then I think as regards
to students ... if they're just asking for
general things about "I don't understand what Git is?" I mean you
can help explain that but you can also say "hey, you know, look - why not
do a search for Git textbook or here's some relevant
links to be looking at and so on", but the key thing generally is
I guess if they've got a course specific question
then ideally you help students
as a TA in the forums, in the chat, in the Hangouts,
instead of saying
online search ... I mean ... there's this issue that as we know the
homework answers
are kind of out there ... it's
... the whole reason to put the course in place is to help people
learn
actually if you're just looking up the answers online you're not ... you're kind
of undercutting your own learning ... so I think we wanna
generally be clear about how ... that we shouldn't be sharing
answers with each other. It's all about this we
want to help each other learn. We want to
scaffold each other rather than just
allow people to copy answers
verbatim ... if you're in a position to answer a question do
answer it
... general points ...
make sure that your information is correct. If you are unsure about
your information do check with others
first; particularly as regards the upcoming course
then do complete assignments in a week in advance and
you will know what's going on ... similarly with distributed teams
sometimes if you're too hasty in jumping in offering
advice when it may be the wrong one that can undermine the team activity
and particularly from the course side of things encourage
learning and reading and also particularly pairing ... I'm a big big fan of
pairing; we'll talk more about that later in the lecture sequence this week.
So here's kind of like a set of
little guidelines from ... we've
pulled together from the ... our experiences in
in the MOOC
so far which I think
also refers to managing communication with distributed teams;
that's - sometimes there's going to be language barriers; so
sometimes you'll need to say, "Right, I wanna rephrase it
I'm gonna try and use examples" ... there's courseware issues
... so there's gonna be for any given
assignment there's gonna be common problems
... I'll try and give your a prep on those week by week as we go through
... if you can do the
homework assignments in advance that would be
very helpful ...
sometimes students will come in saying ... I mean as you can imagine this is
customers coming into a distributed
team and saying: "Look, well we've tried to install your software on this other
unsupported OS or IDE" and the situation there is to be polite and say
"Yes we're focusing on supporting
these platforms with the VM and so on" and so ...
Sure, if you can help them solve that issue ... but prioritize people
who are having issues with the courseware and recommend to people doing
alternate stuff that they should use the courseware
because that is trying to make our own ability to manage everybody's
issues ... manage them more effectively
... if you don't know the answer .. come and talk
and we'll work it out ... this is one of the great
opportunities - a student may be exploring some aspect of some
issue that you hadn't got into when you
did the course previously so this is an opportunity for your own learning
... if the student's gone off there - out into the blue
if they're off doing their "yak shaving activity" ...
you wanna say: "You seem to be getting right off track and
let's see if we can get you back to the right place"
... and then also there's ... as you're aware we have the auto graders which
will grade
student homeworks ... and
sometimes students will say, oh it's the autograder that's not working ... often it's actually
some sort of
homework issue
... or I mean I'd certainly say that we've got
issues with the
auto graders and sometimes the error messages they
give are difficult to interpret
that's something
we're trying to fix but ... if it does seem that the autograders are down
then the key thing is to let me know as soon as possible and do that
through
Skype chat ... so
finally we've got helping students solve problems efficiently
... there's going to be times ... when they've installed ...
they have installation issues so look out for ...
skipped or incomplete steps ... if they haven't mastered the directions and this is
the
kind of situation sometimes where it can take a
long time in chat to work out what's
going on but if you're in a Hangout
and they show you oh well I did this and I did
this and they can show you the history of their
activity on the UNIX command line you can see oh yes you didn't do this
this one thing or that thing and
if they have ... their homework is failing ... look
out for the student including features that weren't required
that they're touching the wrong bits of the code ... they're having
trouble
interpreting the exception error messages ... and actually you say ... I
say this -
I think this comes up in distributed teams all the time ... working with
... the client has done a spec and the developer working on
the code says: "Oh yes we could use this and we could use this" and
so this is the skills of the TA
not so different from that of a project manager of
a distributed team
you need to be helping your developers focus on
exactly the parts of code they need to be focusing on so ...
you're getting a real value for money, as it were, putting your time as a
TA
I think it really does ... I'm constantly. agonizing about: "Oh no we're doing too many
things with this course we're teaching you about
distributed teams, we're teaching you about being a TA
I think there is a lot of overlap; but yeah so that's communicating effectively in online
forums
... I hope that's helpful and I look forward to communicating with all of you in
the online forums as the course goes forward. Alright, bye for now.
