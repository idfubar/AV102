Hey so I want to tell you about creating Hangouts and events on the AgileVentures site and I'm
recording all this with the QuickTime Player so that I can show you how the Hangouts work.
So I think you're all familiar with Hangouts, Google Hangouts. Although Google is now re-branding
them to be called YouTube Live, and they're starting something called Meet, but anyway
... many of you will have been in Hangouts this week ... but you might ask:
"Why? If I'm doing some programming why do I want to be in a Hangout?"
I think an interactive video is sometimes worth a billion words ... it's just ... in
a picture sometimes it illuminates things, sometimes that process of just being able
to say to somebody:
"Look just this thing here or just well, it's this bit there!"
and have that coordinated discussion around something can really sort things out.
So I think it's great for problem solving and I really love Hangouts for pair programming.
I know some people say:
"Oh well you know if you don't have control of each others computers like with
Screen Hero or something it's not real pair programming!"
but actually I think if you're using GitHub Pong, which is actually my preferred mode
for pair programming remotely using a Hangout, then you get to practice your Git skills and
you get a Git record of what you've done.
I've now done hundreds of hours of pair programming with people all round the world through hangouts
and just ... I love it. Hangouts lets you see switch back and forth quickly between multiple
people's screens, which is really great for collaboration.
Also since it's just screen share you can use all kinds of other tools in combination
with the Hangout like C9, GitHub Pong and so on in order to share the code back and
forth.
The key thing I would say is that you really don't need a webcam. If you do and want to
share a video of your face that's great, but its the screenshare functionality of the Hangout
that's really really valuable and so you can both be working on C9, or you could be working
in your own editor and doing GitHub Pong backwards and forwards and have a group of you.
I've done five-way GitHub Pong in different sessions before in Hangouts. The point is
that the hangouts themselves are so flexible and they allow you to stream and record video
of the sessions to YouTube and it's just, I don't know it's great! Thank you Google
:-)
So there are various options to use Hangouts, but I'm just going to show you about
how we can create Google Hangouts through the AgileVentures site.
We have an events feed and this is what we're going to be using to coordinate the pair programming
for the MOOC.
So we've got AgileVentures there and we've got events there.
So you can see upcoming events and there's a button for create new event there that you
can use if you want to create a pair programming event,
you can do that [BUTTON CLICK] - and pop it in there [BUTTON CLICK] - and that will create an event like these many events that
we have in the system and then these events have the ability to start a Hangout on Air
and you may ask what's a Hangout on Air?
That means it's recordable and it's also streamable so all of the Hangouts that we do for our
AgileVenture Scrums or stand-ups and so on, they are all run through the AgileVentures
site.
What I would do here for example is there's the next Scrum coming up in a couple of hours.
The way I was creating all of those Hangouts for the stand-ups and so on was by
using this button here "Start a Hangout on Air"
and by using these AgileVentures events and Hangout integration we can work out when to
meet and notify people of the Scrum hangout link in Slack.
If we create an event as a pair programming session as I was just doing here then it appears
in the events list but it doesn't appear with the timer and the counter on our home page
and in the popup.
Those are specifically for scrums or stand-ups.
So the big change we've had is that Google has retired the Hangout API, which means that
our events no longer ping Slack or Gitter automatically, so if you want that to happen
so that others can enter your Hangout, you'll have to take the Hangout URL from the address
bar and update the event manually.
It's a real pain and I'm sure lots of people will forget or find it hard, but at the moment
we don't have a replacement for Google Hangout plugins. Hopefully soon, but if we create
a pair programming event that starts in a minute or two and start the hangout like so:
So if we start that we'll see the URL.
Of course we have to click through the disclaimer about being recorded which some people get
kind of freaked out about.
Personally I've been recording my life and posting it online
for much of the last three or four years and I don't seem to have had any problems yet,
but it's not for everybody.
And then grab the URL from the address bar and go back into the event
and open "Event Actions" like so and click "Edit Hangout link" and paste the URL in like
so, and then "Save" it, then we should see the event go live on the site, and now other
people can click here to access the Hangout and we should see a notification in Slack
where we've got a pairing notifications channel so you can see here that we've got pair programming
going on different projects and so on and so on.
So in principle you can just get access to the Hangouts there, but, and this is the other
reason I absolutely love Google Hangouts is that you start to hang out and you get the
link and then you can paste it in into an email or into another chat room and you have
a simple mechanism for getting people into the same room that doesn't involve inviting
them and waiting for other automated systems to kick in.
I'm also a huge fan of Hangouts on Air.
I really insisted on that in the AgileVentures site, that all of the Hangouts created should
be recordable.
Not automatically recorded! Just that they are at least recordable, as I think it's so
useful to be able to keep a record of what you did in the Hangout.
You have to press the record button to actually record.
Note that one of the things we have here is that the event host, which in principle can
be anybody with a YouTube linked account can start this hangout on air ...
so if you're doing a stand-up or a Scrum, it's sensible that the event host would do it but
in principle for pairing sessions ...
maybe one person who gets there first - or it's a group of you or what have you whoever gets there
first - can make the room - or Hangout - and then you all kind of get in there.
Now over here you can see we've got the green start broadcast button at the bottom and that
that will actually start recording and also start live streaming ...
if you look at the links thing down here you get a YouTube page and so if you do click
the start broadcast button which of course is entirely up to you. I pretty much record
and broadcast everything I do ...
like to be there for the future alien archeologists but also just to be available generally for
others to review ...
then this YouTube page which is initially the stream then becomes the recording of the
session which I think is very very useful.
I totally love that feature.
So there you go, I hope that will help you all start and run your own Hangouts for pair
programming.
Bye for now :-)
