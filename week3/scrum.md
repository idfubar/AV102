they are limited and ... yeah that
allows work to get done but
members the team to sort of communicate with each other and help each other
because what you ... when you think about the alternative where you're
working
largely independently from somebody for two weeks and you spent
forty-eight hours being blocked on something that the person two desks down had
fixed the other week ... particularly in the distributed environment
... you haven't got quite the same bumping into people at the water cooler
... and so on. So doing the Scrum effectively online;
extraordinarily important. So then other events that you might have are the
Sprint Review event.
So once the sprint has been done and you've released stuff,
the idea is this shouldn't take more than four hours, maybe two meetings
... this would have the product owner
and also the stakeholders involved
and you'd kind of be reporting back to say you know what is being done;
what should be done next ... and
yeah, you need to demonstrate the product - what you've ... what you've
produced
and so you need to be able to do that within the time constraints, usually
four hours, unless it is a very complex product then that should be enough ... and then also how to
demonstrate it
without being boring. I mean that's just, I think you know ...
can people be trained not to be boring? I'm not sure ... its
you just ... need to make sure that when you're, for example, explaining
something to the stakeholder who's the interested
customer
you're not telling them all about the - the details of the new continuous integration
system that you've got working
its about showing them the things that are important
to them and
yes so I mean as an example on ... what we have
... in LocalSupport, which is one the biggest AgileVentures projects -
we kind of have the customer meeting, I guess as our Sprint Review
events every week and so we have our
... we actually do that in always less than an hour.
It never takes more than an hour I think and I guess we're on a seven-day
cycle there to make that work so then there's also
the retrospective event which is
you know ... the Review event is sort of you're presenting to the
customer
the Retrospective event is more where you're saying right okay the methodology
that we use -
you know our Scrums seem to be going you know bleeding over to like 20 minutes 30
minutes on a regular basis
... you know I couldn't access the
backlog frequently enough, the management tool for
tracking about backlog
was going offline ... all these sorts of things I mean
that to try and ... you don't want to be you know
given that you've worked out some process to go through the sprint you don't
want to be blindly repeating that sprint
and hitting the same issues and issues again and again. of course
those things can come up in the daily Scrum. You've got like
an individual block here might be related not just to the technology
that you're working with or some particular product;
they're to do with blocks "I keep on spending all my time in meetings and I can't bear it" or
what-have-you so there's an extent to which
